# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project is a comprehensive movie recommendation system. It leverages both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations. The system integrates data from IMDb and The Movie Database (TMDb) and uses a SQLite database for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on user behavior and preferences.

Hybrid Recommendation System: Combines content-based and collaborative filtering for more accurate recommendations.
